                    <p>An interactive bus stop featured in an exhibition at The Edge in Southbank. Developed within a team of four, the project had the overall goal to explore the nature of human selfishness in an everyday life and its relationship to ignorance.</p>
                    <p>The system consisted of bespoke weight sensors, facial recognition and a program written in Unity3D (C#). Outside this original exhibit, the project won the Best Non-Thesis Prize at the 2018 UQ Innovation Showcase, completing against a wide and varied field from the Information Technology and Electrical Engineering school.</p>
                    <p>Along with collaboratively designing and developing the overarching system, I individually created the promotional material used for the exhibit. This was used to highlight the design process, team input and background research. All elements were personally created, with the Transport Brisbane theme being well represented in the typography and colour scheme. Due to the discreet nature of the bus stop, all elements had to be subtle and inconspicuous to hide the true nature of the project.</p>
                    <p>In the development of the system, I also learned a valuable design lesson. Halfway through the design phase, the team pitched the project, along with a personally created high-fidelity prototype. Although I was very proud of the system, it was shown to be ineffective in accomplishing our initial goals and research.</p>
                    <p>As difficult as it was, we decided to scrap the current design and refocus our effort into satisfying these gathered user requirements. Evidently this was highly beneficial and reinforced the notion that I am not my end user.</p>
