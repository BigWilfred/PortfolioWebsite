                    <p>Web application designed and developed within the Social & Mobile Computing course. Created within a multidisciplinary team, considering the concepts that underpin interaction design and computer-supported cooperative work. Explores technologies relationship to the social context they operate within.</p>
                    <p>Personally responsible for developing incremental prototypes included the delivered high-fidelity example, as well as conducting user test sessions. Worked within strict time constraints, making my personal willingness to work efficiently within a small design team crucial to the overall success of the project.</p>
                    <p>Deliverable prototype had the constraint of only using client-side technology, initially limiting the breath of the system. It also removed some interactive elements of the application that were discovered that the user required. This constraint was remediated by storing data in the browser session, effectively mimicking the function of a full, three-tier system.</p>
