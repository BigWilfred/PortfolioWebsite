                    <p>Web application designed and developed within the Social & Mobile Computing course. Explores technologies relationship to the social context it operate within and its tangible impact on the surrounding environment.</p>
                    <p>Created within a multidisciplinary team, considering the concepts that underpin interaction design and computer-supported cooperative work. Personally responsible for developing the incremental prototypes, including the delivered high-fidelity example, as well as conducting user test sessions.</p>
                    <p>Worked within a strict timeframe, making my personal willingness to work efficiently within a small design team crucial to the overall success of the project. Primary and secondary research was conducted to understand the target user, with the overall goal of the project to increase the sense of community on campus.</p>
                    <p>Deliverable prototype had the constraint of only using client-side technology, limiting the breath of the system and removed some interactive, required elements. This would have made it difficult to successfully pitch the final prototype, as fundamental sections would have been absent.</p>
                    <p>I remediated this constraint by storing data in the browser session, effectively mimicking the function of a full three-tier website. This highlights my ability to creatively solve a problem when options are limited.</p>
