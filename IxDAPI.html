                    <p>RESTful API to be used for the IxD@UQ Project Repository website. System was designed and developed for a client, introducing professional processes such as client communication, expectation management and formal meetings.</p>
                    <p>External teams were creating dependent systems parallel to our API, introducing realistic and unique challenges, such as communicating back-end processed in a simplistic but meaningful way.</p>
                    <p>I was personally responsible for developing the Node.js API back-end. This was my first exposure to Node, having to independently learn its structure by using the official documentation. </p>
                    <p>When designing and developing the API, database coverage, efficient route structure and data security were heavily and constantly considered. The system employs a public facing Nginx server to reverse proxy the Node API server.</p>
                    <p>One of the most difficult challenges I faced was the implementation of the API key system. The system has four distinct user groups, with each request needing to be checked and determine if they met the minimum privilege level. This has exposed me to security best-practises, such as safe storage of private keys, and developed my interest in cryptography.</p>
